# Convet Image To Cartoon 

## This is a simple Python script which will convert a image to a cartoon image.

### Requirements For The Script

***NOTE: This process is only for debian based Operating Systems.***

- Installing Python3
    

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3
```

- Installing pip3
```
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
```
- Installing tkinter
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
I have used tkinker in this script for making the script more user friendly.
- Installing Open CV
```
$ pip3 install cv2
```
### Changes In The Script

I have developed this script on an Ubuntu based distro (Kubuntu).
So you will have to change line `19` according to your OS.
```python
19  output = "/home/user/Pictures/cartoon.jpg" 
```
Instead of **user**, add your **user name**.

### Running The Script 

- To run this script type
```
$ python3 cartoon.py
``` 
You can edit this script as per your preference and as per your OS.
